These are my notes and solutions for the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com)

## **SPOILERS AHEAD**
The table below tracks my progress but also gives away the URLs needed to progress in the challenge.
Please do not look ahead if you want to solve these challenges yourself.

This is a table of Level numbers and names. To gain access to a particular solution, you
have to use the name of the next level, but substitute the 'pc' in the URL for 'pcc'. This will
provide you with a link valid for 24 hours. For example, to get the solution for level 0 to open up,
you would have to put the following URL in: http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pcc/def/map.html

[Solution main page](http://wiki.pythonchallenge.com/index.php?title=Main_Page)

Solution URLs take the form:
http://wiki.pythonchallenge.com/index.php?title=Level0:Main_Page
* Substitute the level number to get to the desired page.

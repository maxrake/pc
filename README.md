# Python Challenge
These are my notes and solutions for the [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com)

## Goals
My primary goal is to practice more Python and learn about helpful modules.
I am interested in learning best of breed modules and so I don't restrict myself to the batteries only approach.
For instance, the `requests` package is used in places where `urllib` would have sufficed but I wanted to get better at using `requests`.

My secondary goals:
* get better with Python virtual environments
* learn PyLint
* become natural in my PEP8 and PEP257 usage
* learn Markdown syntax
* get better with git

## Install Requirements
My solution is based on Python 3.5 and uses third party packages.
I also use Microsoft's Visual Studio 2015 and Python Tools for Visual Studio as my IDE but that environment is not required to follow my solutions.
All you really need to do is install the 3rd party packages with `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file provided.
When using 3rd party packages, it is recommended to use a virtual environment:

    C:\dev\pc> python -m venv VENV
    C:\dev\pc> VENV\Scripts\activate
    (VENV) C:\dev\pc> pip install -r PythonChallenge\requirements.txt

## **SPOILERS AHEAD**
The table below tracks my progress but also gives away the URLs needed to progress in the challenge.
Please do not look ahead if you want to solve these challenges yourself.

This is a table of Level numbers and names. To gain access to a particular solution, you
have to use the name of the next level, but substitute the 'pc' in the URL for 'pcc'. This will
provide you with a link valid for 24 hours. For example, to get the solution for level 0 to open up,
you would have to put the following URL in: http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pcc/def/map.html

[Solution main page](http://wiki.pythonchallenge.com/index.php?title=Main_Page)

Solution URLs take the form:
http://wiki.pythonchallenge.com/index.php?title=Level0:Main_Page
* Substitute the level number to get to the desired page.
